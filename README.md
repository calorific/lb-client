# Lunchbench Web Client

This is the official web client for Lunchbench, an open api (coming soon!) which everyone will be allowed to contribute to, to help document picnicspots around the world. It is built with Next.js.

*N.B.: As this has only just been open-sourced, I'm still finishing setting up bits of the project, so it's not done (yet!)*

## More about the project

Lunchbench's API will allow everyone to contribute, either directly using something like Postman, or through a client (like this one). An app is also in the works, so stay tuned!

All the parts of the project will be hosted under the GitHub organisation [Calorific](https://github.com/calorific).

<!-- ## Funding

When the API goes live, I will be paying for the hosting myself, but I will set up donations, probably via *Buy Me A Coffee*, if you want to contribute. -->

## Bugs/Exposed API Keys

If you find any bugs, please open an issue. Any API keys exposed before the commit called "Open-Sourcing the client!" should have been regenerated and put in as environmental variables, but if you find any, please email me [here](mailto:mynameisprivate3@gmail.com).
