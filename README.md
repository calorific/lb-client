# Lunchbench Web Client

![Powered by Vercel](public/vercel.svg)

This is the official web client for Lunchbench, an open api ([lunchbench/api](https://github.com/lunchbench/api)) which everyone will be allowed to contribute to, to help document picnicspots around the world. It is built with Next.js.

## More about the project

Lunchbench's API will allow everyone to contribute, either directly using something like Postman, or through a client (like this one). An app is also in the works, so stay tuned!

All the parts of the project will be hosted under the GitHub organisation [Lunchbench](https://github.com/lunchbench).

If you want to find out more, head to the [docs](https://lunchbench-docs.vercel.app).

<!-- ## Funding

When the API goes live, I will be paying for the hosting myself, but I will set up donations, probably via *Buy Me A Coffee*, if you want to contribute. -->

## Bugs/Exposed API Keys

If you find any bugs, please open an issue. Any API keys exposed before the commit called "Open-Sourcing the client!" should have been regenerated and put in as environmental variables, but if you find any, please email me [here](mailto:mynameisprivate3@gmail.com).
