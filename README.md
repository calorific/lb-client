# Lunchbench Client

This is the official web client for Lunchbench, an open api (coming soon!) which everyone will be allowed to contribute to, to help document picnicspots around the world.

*N.B.: As this has only just been open-sourced, I'm still finishing setting up bits of the project, so it's not done (yet!)*

## Bugs/Exposed API Keys

If you find any bugs, please open an issue. Any API keys exposed before the commit called "Open-Sourcing the client!" should have been regenerated and put in as environmental variables, but if you find any, please email me [here](mailto:mynameisprivate3@gmail.com).
